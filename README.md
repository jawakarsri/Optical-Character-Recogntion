# Optical-Character-Recogntion

To access the dataset, the project starts by mounting Google Drive and loading the required libraries. A dataset of handwritten letters from A to Z is loaded, and the data is preprocessed by dividing it into training and testing sets, rearranging the input data, and transforming the labels to a format that is one-hot encoded.

It then constructs a CNN model with various convolutional and pooling layers, fully connected layers, and a softmax output layer using the Keras toolkit. After that, an optimizer, a loss function, and assessment metrics are added to the model.

To determine how well the model performs, it is tested on test data after being trained using training data. Furthermore, matplotlib is used to visualize the accuracy and loss during training and validation.

Lastly, the trained model is saved, and matplotlib and OpenCV are used to create sample predictions on test data, presenting both the model's predictions and the actual images.

All things considered, this code snippet provides a thorough illustration of how to apply a CNN-based method for handwritten character identification. It can be used for instructional reasons or as a springboard for additional research and development in the area of image classification.
